  <p>
    The <strong>AI Resume Analyzer</strong> is a web application that helps job seekers improve their resumes. 
    Users can upload a resume and optionally add a job description. The app analyzes the resume, highlights 
    missing keywords, scores it against the job description, and provides actionable tips to improve chances 
    of passing Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).
  </p>
  <p>
    This project is built using <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>Express</strong> for the server, 
    <strong>Supabase</strong> for user management and data storage, and <strong>Google Gemini AI</strong> 
    for resume analysis and suggestions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal is to make resume optimization simple, fast, and effective for job applications.
